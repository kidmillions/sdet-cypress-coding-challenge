### The Challenge

**Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to write some Cypress tests that assert correct behaviors for the MUI DateRangePicker component.**

In addition to implementing the tests, defining the correct behaviors is a part of the challenge. What should we be checking for?

This repo is a simple react boilerplate bootstrapped with [vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

It includes the following major dependencies:

- vite
- react
- eslint
- prettier
- typescript
- [mui (Material UI)](https://mui.com/components)
- [cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/and#Syntax)

The app only renders a single MUI DateRangePicker with minimal props and includes one Cypress test.

You are welcome to reference any documentation you wish, and we recommend you look at the Mui documentation for its DateRangePicker:
